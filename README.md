#AI-Powered Agricultural Robot
Project Overview:
The AI-Powered Agricultural Robot is an innovative, low-cost solution designed to enhance eco-friendly farming. Built using Arduino UNO R3 and ESP32-CAM, it leverages AI to detect plant diseases and spray pesticides precisely when needed. The robot monitors environmental conditions using sensors and provides real-time data visualization through a Firebase-based cloud dashboard.

Features:
AI Disease Detection: Utilizes ESP32-CAM for AI-based plant disease identification.
Environmental Monitoring: Employs DHT22, soil moisture, and ultrasonic sensors for comprehensive monitoring.
Automated Spraying: Servo-controlled pump for targeted pesticide application.
Autonomous Movement: Stops upon plant detection for precise operation.
Cloud Dashboard: Real-time data visualization using Firebase.

Hardware Requirements:
Arduino UNO R3
ESP32-CAM
DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
Soil Moisture Sensor
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
Servo Motor
Water Pump
DC Motors with Wheels
Robot Chassis
Battery Pack (e.g., 9V or 12V)

Software Requirements:
Arduino IDE
TensorFlow (for AI model training)
Google Colab (for model development)
Firebase SDK (for cloud dashboard)
Web browser (for accessing the dashboard)

Setup Instructions:
Hardware Assembly:
Connect sensors (DHT22, soil moisture, ultrasonic) to Arduino UNO.
Attach ESP32-CAM for AI processing and camera input.
Mount servo motor and water pump for spraying mechanism.
Assemble DC motors and wheels on the robot chassis.
Power the system with a battery pack.


AI Model Training:
Use Google Colab to train a TensorFlow model for plant disease detection.
Export the trained model to the ESP32-CAM.


Software Setup:
Install Arduino IDE and required libraries (e.g., ESP32, Firebase).
Upload the Arduino sketch to the UNO for sensor and motor control.
Configure ESP32-CAM with the AI model and camera settings.


Firebase Integration:
Set up a Firebase Realtime Database project.
Integrate Firebase SDK into the Arduino code for data syncing.
Develop a web/mobile dashboard using Firebase SDK.


Testing and Deployment:
Test the robot on sample plants in a controlled environment.
Deploy in field conditions, monitoring performance and refining as needed.



Webpage Documentation:
The project includes a responsive webpage built with HTML, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
Features a multilingual interface (English, Bengali, Hindi, Punjabi, Bhojpuri, Telugu, Malayalam, Tamil, Marathi).
